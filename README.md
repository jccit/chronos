This program is designed to play a series of 24 looping audio files, each corresponding to the hour of the day.

Create a folder called `music` and place flac files in this folder named `00.flac` `01.flac` `02.flac` etc.

Originally designed to be used with [Animal Crossing: Taking Root by Scruffy](https://scruffymusic.bandcamp.com/album/animal-crossing-taking-root-2)
